## Description

This is a hobby project of mine. The goal is to make multiple projects, and integrate everything into one, just for fun. Ideally all functions should be available in every client, but certain client specific functions are welcomed to make E.L.I.A. more usable (e.g.: Discord music playing).

Every project should contain an interaction with a user, so overall all the projects as a whole make E.L.I.A.

To read more about certain parts of E.L.I.A. read the respective README files in the subfolders.
 
## Structure

| Codebase         |    Description    |
| :--------------- | :---------------: |
| [comet](discord) | Discord.js client |

## Branches

TODO

## Contributions

E.L.I.A. is open to contributions, but I recommend creating an issue or replying in a comment to let me know what you are working on first that way we don't overwrite each other.

## How to run locally

Because E.L.I.A. is a multiple projects combined, optimally, you should run all the projects to make it run E.L.I.A. In practice you need to run the systems that needed for the current part you're working on.
